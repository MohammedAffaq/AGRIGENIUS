# AGRIGENIUS : Multipurpose Agricultural Robot
The design and structure of Agricultural Robot is one such attempt to help the farmers  reap the benefits of technological advancement and to get benefits.

METHODOLOGY: 
The multipurpose robot system operates on a 12V battery, providing the necessary power 
for its functionalities. The base frame, equipped with 4 wheels connected to a motor driver, 
enables mobility and maneuverability, crucial for navigating different terrains and performing 
agricultural tasks efficiently. The inclusion of a servo motor for ploughing enhances precision 
and control during soil preparation, ensuring optimal conditions for planting and growth. 
Similarly, the weed cutter, also driven by the servo motor, tackles unwanted vegetation, 
contributing to maintaining a clean and productive farming environment. These mechanical 
components, combined with the power management system, form the backbone of the robot's 
physical operations, allowing it to perform agricultural tasks effectively. In terms of sensing 
technology, the integration of sensors like the Temperature and humidity sensor, Soil moisture 
sensor, and Ultrasonic sensor serves specific purposes in agricultural monitoring and 
management. The Temperature and humidity sensor provides insights into environmental 
conditions, helping in optimizing crop growth parameters such as temperature and humidity 
levels. The Soil moisture sensor plays a crucial role in irrigation management by monitoring 
soil moisture content, ensuring efficient water usage and preventing over or under-watering of 
crops. Additionally, the Ultrasonic sensor aids in obstacle detection and navigation, enhancing 
the robot's ability to manoeuvre safely through the farm environment. These sensors, working 
in tandem, contribute to data-driven decision-making in agriculture, promoting sustainable 
practices and improving crop yields.
